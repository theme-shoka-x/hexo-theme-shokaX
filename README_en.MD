This project is a secondary development version of shoka (spiritual sequel), dedicated to improving performance and optimizing modding experience.
The reason for its birth is that shoka has not been updated for two years, with a large backlog of bugs and feature requests.

The community resource navigation and plugin repository for shokaX is [awesome-shokaX](https://github.com/theme-shoka-x/awesome-shokaX)

## 💬 Differences with shoka
The original shoka used javascript+Native+nunjucks technology, while shokaX uses typescript+Vue 3+Pug technology and has changed a lot of hard-to-access CDN links.
